# AAPL Sell-Side Trade Execution Optimization

## Project Title and Purpose

This project is designed to optimize the sell-side trade execution of 1,000 shares of AAPL over a single trading day. It compares traditional trading strategies, such as Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP), with a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By leveraging machine learning, this project aims to minimize transaction costs, slippage, and market impact.

## Requirements

The main libraries and dependencies for this project are:
- `stable-baselines3`: For implementing the SAC reinforcement learning model.
- `gym` and `gymnasium`: To create the custom trading environment.
- `pandas` and `numpy`: For data manipulation and calculations.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AAPL-Trade-Execution-Optimization.git
   cd AAPL-Trade-Execution-Optimization
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the AAPL data file**: 
   Obtain historical AAPL data with fields like `timestamp`, `bid_price_1`, `bid_size_1`, etc., and place the file (`AAPL_Quotes_Data.csv`) in the project directory.

## Usage Guide

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Run the initial setup script to load data, calculate VWAP, and verify columns.
   
2. **Running Benchmark Strategies (TWAP and VWAP)**:
   - The `Benchmark` class in `benchmark.py` generates trade schedules for TWAP and VWAP.
   - To simulate these strategies, run:
     ```python
     from benchmark import Benchmark
     data = pd.read_csv('AAPL_Quotes_Data.csv')
     benchmark = Benchmark(data)
     twap_trades = benchmark.get_twap_trades(data, initial_inventory=1000)
     vwap_trades = benchmark.get_vwap_trades(data, initial_inventory=1000)
     ```

3. **Running the RL Model**:
   - The `TradingEnv` environment (in `rl_trading.py`) provides state observations for the RL model.
   - SAC model training can be run with:
     ```python
     from rl_trading import TradingEnv
     env = TradingEnv(data)
     model = SAC("MlpPolicy", env, ...parameters...).learn(total_timesteps=20000)
     ```

4. **Generating Outputs**:
   - Trade schedules for TWAP and VWAP are saved as JSON files for review.
   - Results include cost metrics, slippage, and fill rate details, available in the console and JSON files.

## Design and Implementation

The project includes three main components:
1. **TWAP and VWAP Benchmark Strategies**: Defined in the `Benchmark` class, these strategies provide baselines by distributing trades evenly (TWAP) or according to volume (VWAP) over the day.
2. **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Model**: Using the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm, the RL model adapts trade size and timing based on evolving market conditions.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: The project evaluates each approach by calculating slippage, market impact, and transaction costs, enabling performance comparison between TWAP, VWAP, and the RL-based model.

## Key Metrics

- **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**: Splits trades evenly over time, reducing the risk of price fluctuations.
- **VWAP (Volume-Weighted Average Price)**: Executes trades based on market volume, aiming to match the average price.
- **Slippage**: The difference between expected and actual execution prices, an indicator of price movement impact.
- **Market Impact**: The effect of large trade volumes on price, which the model seeks to minimize.
- **Transaction Cost Calculations**: Measures the effectiveness of each strategy by quantifying the total cost incurred, combining slippage and market impact.
